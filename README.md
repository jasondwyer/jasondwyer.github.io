# Jason Dwyer

This is the personal site of Jason Dwyer, PhD. I am a neuroscientist and a software developer and I'm deeply interested in the interface of those things. I believe that biology and neuroscience can inform software development (indeed it already has) and vice versa. I develop mostly for objective c, javascript (node.js) and python. I am currently working on several side projects in machine learning and mobile (iOS), but my main development focus is based on a stealth financial technology project.
