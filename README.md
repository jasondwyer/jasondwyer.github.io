# Jason Dwyer

This is the personal site of Jason Dwyer, PhD. I am a data scientist, neuroscientist and a software developer and I'm deeply interested in the interface of those things. I believe that biology and neuroscience can inform software development (indeed it already has) and vice versa. I code in objective c, swift, javascript (node.js) and python. I am currently building various mobile and web apps and some machine learning tools.
