I am a neuroscientist and software developer, and I'm deeply interested in the interface of those things. I believe that biology and neuroscience can significantly inform software development and vice versa. I develop mostly for objective c, javascript (node.js) and python. In my spare time I am developing several side projects in machine learning and mobile dev (iOS), and I founded @branebits, an indie game studio that makes games for iPhone and iPad.
