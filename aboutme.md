I am currently a Data Scientist working in the healthcare space. I study neuroscience and software development, and I'm deeply interested in the interface of those things. I believe that biology and neuroscience can significantly inform software development and vice versa. I develop mostly for Objective C, Javascript (Node.js) and Python. In my spare time I am developing several side projects in machine learning and mobile development (iOS and Android), and I founded @branebits, an indie game studio that makes games for iPhone and iPad.
