I've always preferred to build my iOS dev views programmatically rather than use Interface Builder. Setting view frames can be challenging, especially if you are making a universal app that can be used on both the iPhone and iPad. I developed `ULRRect` to take some of the pain away from building view frames. It provides a few helper methods to determine device size, create adaptive view frames proportional to the size of the device screen, and create adaptive font sizes that scale up if the device is an iPad. You can see the docs [here](https://jasondwyer.github.io/ulrrect) and the github repository [here](https://github.com/jasondwyer/ulrrect). It's MIT licensed so use it however you see fit. And if you find any ways to improve it, please feel free to send me a pull request.
